,i mean  apple music is a really good app especially when you want to find songs but one time i was looking for a really good song by melanie martinez and turns out the song wasnt even there i did this a few other times with some other songs and it wasnt there either and yes  their actual songs do not just some made up songs so the only improvement that i think apple music should make is excepting more recent songs because the songs im really looking for is there only speed up and i just want a normal songs and sometimes theyre not even sped up well yeah thats all i have to say because thats the only improvement this app needs ,3,1/10/2023 21:53,Apple Music,IOS

56209a3b-fe49-433b-a5c6-b02d7209395a,youtube music offers a great library of songs that are adfree on premium and easy to access even when offline it also recommends songs and albums based on your search activity from the app and youtube i would say it is worth it especially when on a premium subscription however  without a premium package  its services are stripped down to the basics which dont stand out to any user,4,12/25/2024 8:52,YouTube Music,Android
698095ff-a93f-4285-9c29-6c71a92f2f35,had good features but too invasive abuses you privacy it abuses bluetooth tech to map everything and even tried to connect to unknown devices on by default now it no longer acts online even though everything else works still not happy with paying the ridiculous fee when theyre collecting all the information they get from us they should be paying us however the service has gotten better but theyre not very privacy concerned at all still unfortunately nonexistent,3,2/25/2025 0:20,Spotify,Android

,watch and carplay components dont work well watch should always show currently playing not the very bottom of a playlist selection that i have to scroll to the top of   then selecting the now playing option thats if i didnt scroll too far   scrolling too far minimizes the application and im back home secondly carplay needs a thumbs up and down button you can argue theres too much going happening on the screen in a car but if it was there i wouldnt feel the need to unlock my phone and do it that way while driving if it was just readily available on the carplay screen,3,8/6/2021 14:55,YouTube Music,IOS

,i love this app seriously such an amazing app to use to listen to music of all types i love how it personalizes playlists for you based on what youve been listening to  whats on your rotation i love creating playlists and finding songs that are recommended for me however  the new interface is not great i really liked how the platform looked before the most recent update now my songs are not in alphabetical order making it hard to look for a song to play without searching the song  which means it wont continue with my library after that song i searched  i cant seem to find the specific section for radio listening which could be my own stupidity but still help please  i also feel like my personalization either disappeared or changed for whatever reason  it is playing songs in my library that i either rarely listen to or its not catching onto the vibe im going for for example  it used to play country songs more than other genres if it noticed i was listening to more country than other stuff now it just seems all over the place love the app  just not the new update,4,6/30/2019 6:19,Spotify,IOS

,downloaded the app several years ago  i use it daily and have a vast library of songs of every genre for every mood and every occasion never once have i had an issue with this app a play list for any vibe is easy to create  the selection of music is unparalleled the app is consistently updated  doesnt bug out or fail i really enjoy the weekly discover play list  its an ai generated collection of music that the ai thinks you might enjoy  ive found countless songs i enjoy due to this clever system   highly recommend  its definitely worth the money for add free enjoyment,5,9/9/2022 18:40,YouTube Music,IOS
72727cc3-8913-4c12-8343-d5c32006a608,i spend 30 hrsweek commuting for work downloading music for offline listening has been valuable to me what sucks is that the app fails to successfully load the library or downloaded music page when in poor cellular networking conditions otherwise  the app works when im completely offline  or online overall  the app is okay i pay for premium  so i guess ill always expect more  or basic and offered app functionality and services to work 99 of the time,2,12/19/2024 4:39,YouTube Music,Android
,really good if i could read it so they could have more than five stars in like five is perfect ill read it seven number one because you can use it while using other apps are you sad time especially on roblox because im a big player of roblox next up is a ton of classics like basically every song you could think of is there dance monkey the castle theres fly away there is believer that thunder and many many more and theres even like songs that they include that have like two views and they still are on like your recommended page next up if youre in the younger age groupif youre 12 you can still play songs but it is limited if theyre e you cant play them and how do you put onto that setting is you going to settings and then you look for like restricted stuff and then you press it so the songs that are e are restricted its so good i am still using the app while writing this with you,5,7/16/2021 1:05,Spotify,IOS
,fire app if you have premium  regular you tube is good dont get me wrong but iits so fin worth it to get the music without having to be sold on some bull adds plus you get the music without having to connect to the internet or the added plus of downloading your favorites and being able to play them anytime as long as you have a charge  my opinion anyway,5,12/25/2022 19:52,YouTube Music,IOS
,mostly this is a good app however  there are some features that could really be used the ability to crop a song to choose when it begins and ends would be a fantastic feature to have also being able to edit songs ones that are not through the apple store  personal music to change the title  album name and being able to change a song to have a specific eq as on my personal computer would be a truly great addition also having a few variations of an empty arena effect via eq would be a nice addition as well,3,11/7/2022 6:09,Apple Music,IOS
68ba2198-505d-4897-ad0f-349ebc03ed40,it doesnt let you pick the songs you want so when you play a song it just gives you a random other song and the only way to avoid is just to buy premium,1,2/24/2025 10:35,Amazon Music,Android
,its a good platform for music but you guys have things you guys make people listen to like six different songs until we can listen to the song we actually searched up and only six skips an hour is a little unfair plus i should be able to go back to a certain song on my playlist if i want to not have it say that i cant go back to that song and i also dont like the fact that now i cant go to a playlist and tap on the song i wanna play and then let the let the rest play after  i have to just wait until that song pops up because now it only shows the title of the song and shows what songs are on there but you cant tap and pick a song that you want to listen to and if you wanted to listen to that song  you search it up as i said in the first of this you have to listen to 67 songs before you can even get to it thank you for listening i hope you can make a few changes for the sake of your listeners,4,6/17/2024 1:36,Spotify,IOS
299753b4-728a-4a15-8b52-4fe8eb0bfa65,the app plays one or two songs  then it starts cutting out and then the app closes down completely i have to go into settings and force stop the app and start all over i have the paid version,1,2/15/2025 21:16,YouTube Music,Android
,my low score for this app is for the random shuffle play function under songs  i often use the random option but find this app often  play songs from the same artist and different song title of course  considering this is from google  with advancements with ai it would be good to hear a more mixed up playlists not have the same artist appear much later rather than so closed  i once had it back to back  considering i have so many songs  it would be more randomized,5,11/16/2023 1:49,YouTube Music,IOS
,i would like to use this app 100 of the time instead of google play music  however  there are certain things i dont like   1 when using my airpods  i can double tap to pause  but when i double tap to resumeit doesnt work i need to go directly into the app and hit play hitting play on the lock screen wont work  either  as it just keeps spinning  it forces me to go directly into the app and start the song from the beginning   2 its cool that you can get both audio and videos on the same app but its weird when the app plays the audio of the video version you could be listening to a song video with long pauses that only make sense when youre watching a video,3,9/14/2019 14:15,YouTube Music,IOS

,after having calm for several months now  ive enjoyed exploring to the variety of content from masterclasses to music to meditation i also like the approach calm takes in encouraging you to develop your own daily practice of mindfulness however  the main reason why i purchased calm was for the large library of meditations however the bulk of new meditations come from the daily meditation which is always guided by the same person  tamara levitt she also guides many of the meditation series they have available unfortunately i dont enjoy how tamara does her meditations and i find them more distracting than helpful because of this i find myself avoiding her meditations and whenever there is a choice for another voice ill pick it  but there are only so many of these and  if youre not doing the daily meditations  it doesnt take too long before you feel like youre running out of content calm is great if you enjoy tamaras meditations  but your kind of out of a deal if you dont i just think its unfortunate that there isnt more variety in the voices available and authors coming out with new content my wish would be for calm to at least have a second choice for the voice of the daily calm,2,8/6/2020 16:00,Amazon Music,IOS
afb305ea-a4bc-49e3-9056-01d7b53dbb8c,definitely much better audio quality than spotify  but there is no music streaming option with android phones to your speaker  adding or deleting songs take steps which is boring,4,12/27/2024 21:13,Apple Music,Android

71a6c597-b598-406e-814b-d116cbc529f5,the interface is not clean it is damn cluttered for a paid app finding a song from its original album is too hard because when you search a song or an album it shows 100s of the results of the playlists created by other people the ui must show first the original album and later other playlists because of this reason i prefer my apple music more bcz this kind of cluttered nonsense is not there,1,2/19/2025 7:04,YouTube Music,Android

,i really wanna highlight my distaste for this app i really enjoy music i listen to music most of the time if i want to listen to the same artist for more than a few hours  it will play the same playlist over and over again if i hit a different album hoping to hear new material  ill hear the same playlist as before  with some new songs in the mix and ive been hearing recommendations that go off my playlists  and i just start hearing random tracks that are popular on tik tok the shuffle is terrible ill listen to some songs once or twice  but not every song is good enough to hear every single day ive been hiding songs  because they just arent good enough  and im getting exhausted and listening to music becomes a chore on this app  which is supposed to be something i take pleasure in ruining my favorite music  and making other music thats decent more and more terrible   i used to feel more favorably towards this  listening to artists who have like 23 albums and some singles   and the thing thats really terrible is that the potential is amazing i could use this to explore artists i dont like if im not familiar with an artist i put on their best material and fan favorites but i genuinely do not have a clue how some of my favorite artists get picked for fan favorites  because some artists have consistency but their lowest quality tracks always seem to make the cut first   stop with the awful pre determined playlists,1,1/13/2025 3:49,Spotify,IOS

,i have used apple music for a few years and im generally satisfied however  its frustrating that i cant customize the library page more   i primarily use the library page  and i navigate based on albums i think the app would be better if there were the option to pin things on the library page  so that the exact albumsplaylists i want are at the top  as opposed to just showing my recently added items lately ive been listening a lot to an album i downloaded awhile ago  which means that every time i open the app  i have to navigate to the artists tab  find the artist  then select the album i want if i could just pin the album  it would be so much easier   basically id like it to function the same way as pinning conversations in the messages app   similarly i generally dont make playlists  except for specific uses party  road trip  workout  etc but in my day to day listening  i dont listen to playlists very much i usually listen to albums id rather be able to hide a playlist or somehow remove it from my recenly added   the same way deleting an app from your iphones home screen doesnt remove it from your app library  id like to be able to adjust which items show up when i first open the app,4,11/16/2022 5:38,Apple Music,IOS

,so they gave me a 14 day free trial and i did not know that but when it ran out i was like oh ok im still able to click on a song and listen to it no problem well  no cuz once the free trial ran out to listen to the full song  the playlist would be on shuffle and you would have to wait till the song came on and when you clicked on the song  it would play like 6 seconds of it and then would stop playing that also once the free trial ran out you got to skip 6 songs per hour and the app says well you can just upgrade to premium and so you are like alright ill get premium and then be able to click on a song and listen to it right there and then no it legit says that it does not support premium on the app im my opinion if it cant support it then why put all these premium features why not just make it where those are already built in and you dont have to worry about it but no anyways thats my review i hope yall see this and edit yalls app cuz right now  its trash,1,7/8/2022 6:03,Spotify,IOS

,the calm app is so awesome because each session like in 21 days of calm is a learning opportunity as well as a guided meditation two in one so i learn a single concept to focus on that i try to keep in mind the rest of the day i used to read books about meditation and practice on my own it was a project  time consuming and id forget things i read too  too many concepts at once without time to reflect with calm i learn insightful concepts and ways of thinking  but little by little so it works into my way of being and sticks better also guided meditation helps pull my wondering mind back much better than i do on my own and the guide is so forgiving and compassionate about my wondering mind that i find meditation pleasant rather than frustrating like before,2,7/9/2018 11:40,Amazon Music,IOS

0379f141-05bb-4485-bb99-b21a921a17fc,i love this app  but the reason for 2 stars is because of the downloaded content playback every time  i lose wireless connection playback stops  and i have to restart the media its annoying having to restart the media every couple of minutes because i work in a wireless dead zone with no wifi if the content is downloaded  i shouldnt have to constantly have to restart the media it should constantly play no matter what ive never had this problem with other media services,2,2/3/2025 17:03,Spotify,Android

,this app is great  and i like what they have done with it my only wish is that you dont have to pay for premium to be able to shut your screen off and have the music keep playing in order to keep music playing while having your screen shut off to save battery  you must pay for premium  which i currently cannot get i think the app would be much better with the one small change of being able to shut off the phone and have the app keep playing music that is all i would ask for other than that though  i love the app,4,5/28/2022 18:18,YouTube Music,IOS

,you want the program to exude calm before sleep  yet many of your stories just do not meet your goals  the dragon story is an excellent example of missing the mark as a counselor   it is not a relaxing story at all it depands attention  visualization that is mysteriously dark and it simply misses the mark on helping anyone reach a stage of calm if you are serious about helping those prepare fir sleep you must make major changes changed must include the following  1 have a relaxation exercise that emphasizes breathing techniques  walk through the relaxation exercises stepbystep never ask your users to automatically do them 2 get rid of telling stories you are forcing people to listen and the idea is to turn off the brain so slumber can flow 3 slow down music have you ever considered watching a yoga session or other relaxation programs offered at parks or recreation facilities they are slow moving and quiet use that as your inner movement 4 look at your fabulous name  calm do not give up you will do this i will be in the midst of writing my book if you would like to set up a meeting  please lets discuss a date after 1202,1,11/21/2022 6:47,Amazon Music,IOS

,the app is generally very good  lots of hard to find songs  easy toggle between videos and audio only   biggest gripe is the idiotic way you are forced to select artists you like in order for the app to generate a play list for you  just give us genres and to select and further select artists in that genre from a list and it will work 1000 times better   i cant stand thumbing through countless artists to occasionally select one i like  waaaay to time consuming and too easy to miss some of your favorite artists that way,4,6/3/2020 0:43,YouTube Music,IOS

,ive loved this app so much i love all of it i like the songs lyrics and more but one thing i absolutely dispise as a mobile user is that i cant get more than 6 skips if i want that i need premium another issue is that this dumb app puts random songs that arent in my play list but are similar but if i wanted to use those songs i would put them you should be able to chose whether or not if you have recommended songs because sometimes i want to listen to my play list and it puts songs that i dont like so in my opinion great app except for mobile users so if you have a school laptop get it there beacause you have unlimited skips and  dont have recommended songs so to make this better you should be able to skip every 30 minutes and make it from 6 to 10 skips and the shuffle feature is fine by me,4,7/2/2023 4:57,Spotify,IOS

,i love this app it has many great features 1 the playlists to share around with other people you can them as long as you want with any songs you please 2 all the different song choices is great as well  i can find almost every song i want sadly it fed the have some which is okay as well 3 you can make these storys and make them about anything you want which i think is really cool though i dont listen to them anymore 4 how you can add your own pictures to your playlists  you can sometimes edits other playlists that people made  you can block songs if you dont like them  this choice is mostly for parents in my opinion you also can leave like on other playlists for the problem there are many ads i know you want the money so you put in several ads so people will buy the premium but to be honest  not many people are going to want to especially sense some people come on here to escape the pay for other music apps i am mostly okay with it but it also plays two 30 second ads which in my opinion is annoying  especially when you are taking a bath and just want to listen to some nice music i would recommend this app  but unless you dont want to pay for a subscription  prepare for the ads,5,1/1/2022 3:09,Spotify,IOS
,okay  to start off  the audio quality is great and the music selection is awesome the ads every other song is annoying but ive found a work around im not totally happy with what you get for free and what you get with premium  but hey  a company needs to make money somehow   one thing that has been getting on my nerves for the past few weeks is that the lyrics arent showing up for 90 of the songs im listening to ive cleared cache  restarted  logged out  and reinstalled the app multiple times to see if they would show up  but alas  they have not its kind of an issue considering i want to be able to sing along with whatever im listening to and not have to open google to see what the lyrics are i also want to be able to share certain lyrics which is a feature when the lyrics are available but im not able to because it says cant load them right now,4,4/22/2024 4:29,Spotify,IOS
,i love apple music there is only one aspect i would enjoy more if it were changed if say myself were to not pay for a month  and the subscription is cancelled  to keep the memory of the previously downloaded musicmusic added to library so when i pay the bill again i still have a template of all ive gathered obviously  if i miss a payment i shouldnt be able to listen to the music i pay for  but keep the memory so i can download it when i reinstate my sub thats all  otherwise  i love it,5,12/2/2024 2:00,Apple Music,IOS
,i would not be using yt to stream music if it not for the fact that it were free as the fam pays for yt premium frequently unresponsive  play next feature glitches a few times a week  and if youre offline theres a large lag to access downloaded songs compared to other services you cant remove multiple songs from a playlist at a time  upon each removal youre sent back to the top and have to scroll down to remove one song this issue frustrates me the most,2,10/5/2024 16:22,YouTube Music,IOS
,apple music is definitely worth getting if you want an awesome music app you can download stuff  make as many playlist as you want and there are so many options available i would 100 recommend getting this app as soon as you pay your monthly subscription then there are no extra fees and there are no restrictions at all if you want set up restrictions for your child  such as making sure no explicit songs can be listened to that is one of the options you can add you can also share your playlists the best part is that after you make a playlist apple music gives you suggestions for songs you can add to your playlist based off of songs you have previously listened to overall apple music is definitely worth it if you want a reliable music app that is safe  fun  and awesome for both children and adults then look no further than this app,5,11/29/2024 21:49,Apple Music,IOS
,apple music leaves much to be desired  for a company that once changed the way the world listens to music  they have produced an uninspired attempt at a music player  the layout is clumsy  and its nearly impossible to see the track lengths  also  the library function takes a backseat to apple trying to force its paid subscription content down you throat  and worst of all  theres no sleep timer  which is available on every other audio player known to mankind  the only way to create a sleep timer is through the timer app on your iphone  are you kidding me what is this 2003,2,3/5/2023 11:54,Apple Music,IOS

,starting out  they give you the premium version for 2 weeks  so you can enjoy listening to music while using other apps and also when your phone screen goes to sleep once that trial period ends and you are using the free version of the app  you get 15minute long advertisements and the music stops every 3 songs to ask if you are still listening and forces you to hit the yes button the premium version of this app is great  but making the free version so terrible that it is unusable is a marketing game that im just not going to play this app is worthless to me if i have to constantly interact with it to keep the music playing for more than 10 minutes at a time and the fact is  that its all just a thinly veiled attempt to get you addicted to the convenience of the premium version,1,11/7/2019 19:20,YouTube Music,IOS

,the parameters that they force you through while listening on free mode are pretty ridiculous i could deal with the limited skips  occasional ad and shuffle only but recently ive noticed that they have doubled and even tripled the amount of ads that i have been getting while listening occasionally when you hit shuffle it will tell you to watch a short video for 30 minutes of free listening  and it used to work fine but recently i have been getting 34 ads after activating this prompt  and then promptly receiving 34 more ads after listening to 1 or 2 songs whered my 30 mins of free listening go if theyre gonna slight me they might as well just get rid of the feature  i would say just to ignore the prompt but they will play ads anyway even if you ignore it  it seems that the pop up is simply acting as a way for them to force even more ads on us through dangling the carrot of uninterrupted listening over our heads,5,7/11/2021 11:56,Spotify,IOS

,the latest update has updated some sound quality issues it seems but now it appears the old way was better for me the new way the app layout and function works is more podcast oriented not so oriented to what seemed the original purpose that is to listen to high quality music because i love working and moving stuff around within like songs too and within itself  it is convenient to have it on the home page when the app is first opened  located first and top of the screen i now must go to app library creating more steps and confusion  due to the library shuffling unless pinned even if you have playlist pinned it is not found on the top of the home page anymore i would love to revert this last update less convenient than more please fix revert i will still give it a 5 star due to the app having many features other apps may not such as playback settings  perfect for using on different devices with the ability to create and form playlists exactly how you the listener want i will recommend this app  but please fix the issue,5,10/5/2023 23:56,Spotify,IOS

,i was able to get a one year premium subscription for super cheap with a special deal after using it for a few days  the meditations are fine what i find super frustrating is there is no way to easily filter and search for meditations for example  in another free app  i can filter by time  male vs female voice  key word eg binaural  with or without music  even preview the voice with calm  there is no way to do that you can only pick a category  like sleep or mediation i prefer sleep meditations with music  but i have to literally play at least 30 seconds of each and every one or ff to see if it has it ive already canceled my subscription to ensure it wont renew next year because not at all worth full price at 70 when other apps for way less or free have better navigation and functionality,2,10/14/2023 17:44,Amazon Music,IOS
,when google podcasts went away they said this app would be able to replace it it does not work well for podcasts when you fast forward or go back  to skip ads or if you didnt hear something and want to back up 10 seconds  it creates a loop where it will repeat the same 10 seconds over and over and over sometimes it will jump forward and then it goes back again to the part where you tried to change the time stamp forward or back you cannot make a queue filled with different podcasts episodes in the order you want to listent to them the podcasts were clearly just added here as an afterthought every time i open the app i have to go hunting for what i was just listening to i will give up and go back to apple podcasts its a shame because i really loved all the features of google podcasts,1,6/17/2024 20:09,YouTube Music,IOS

,im really annoyed  because so many songs in my playlists just play two seconds of a song and then completely stop for absolutely no reason not pause  but literally stops and wont let me play the song at all i have no idea why this started happening but it is not anything on my end  it seems to be a bug with playlists the songs play just fine on my computer desktop  but on my phone  this continues to happen where ill play a song in a playlist and it just either wont play at all  or two seconds of it will play and then it stops is anyone else having this problem it started happening a few months ago and ive been waiting for whatever bug this is to get fixed  and it hasnt not every single song does it  but most of them do  and its not a particular artist  its just random note if i look up that song by that artist  the song will play just fine its only when i go into my playlists to play a song that this will happen anyone else having this experience its the most irritating thing,1,3/9/2022 1:43,Spotify,IOS

,allegedly this app was developed by the same team that made google play music  if so  theyre suffered some kind of horrific brain damage in the interim  want to browse your library by artist you might have to scroll for a halfhour to find the artist you want  once you get there  want to see all the albums by that artist sorry  thats a nope  but heres all of the individual tracks in random order  because thats useful  and once you find the track you want  the app will substitute a music video if it exists another feature that no one asked for  thanks  i hate it  forget about editing the metadata for your music  granted  you couldnt do that in the gpm app either  but at least you could do it on the website no more  apparently  seriously  have these developers ever used a freaking ipod  do they have any concept of how a music library should be organized  not that i can tell,2,9/5/2020 13:20,YouTube Music,IOS

,i can find practically anything on apple music i have a much broader music interest than most  so there are a few artist or titles i cannot find here  but i mean obscure things like identifying music from the 1930s  40s  a few specific artists that may have had disagreements with apple  or some uncommon situation like that i have had a family subscription for quite some time i would give apple music an 18 or 19 on a scale that scores 20 as perfection the only remaining goal for apple music is make sure they have every piece of music ever written available and easy to locate  i appreciate all the effort put into building this app well done,5,1/9/2025 5:59,Apple Music,IOS

,apple music is horrible since th august update theyre constantly fixing things that are already perfect instead of dealing with the constant glitches and lag with the app im sick of having to close and reopen the app multiple times just to get one specific functions to work also why did the last update change the queue settings now  when you move a song to the top of the queue  it puts any other song you add to the queue farther down wherever you moved the first song up from its ridiculous considering hundreds of people are commenting the same thing,1,4/28/2023 9:25,Apple Music,IOS
,this app is pretty good as of oct 2021 many of the old bugs that plagued the experience in the past are now resolved and generally the app is reliable it still has random bugs and strange ui controls that arent necessarily showstoppers which is why its not quite 5 stars  for example  it always displays the album art and track details in apple carplay from the first track of a playlist when you start playback with the shuffle all option even though some other track is playing this fixes itself once it advances to the next track  im also not a huge fan of swiping down to completely stop playback and find it not very intuitive it took a while to figure out how to dismiss the playback controls after the x icon was removed in a recent update,4,10/9/2021 14:33,YouTube Music,IOS

,you cannot fix your music preferences or reset them if what you chose originally wasnt perfect there is no solution that fixes it you just have to listen to crap music until the app eventually learns this makes the app and the coordinating subscription useless if you ever change your music tastes  or only like some music occasionally you can like and dislike all you want  the change wont happen on your schedule possibly not ever apparently  apple thinks we have time to waste on mistakes they dont want to deal with rather just find an app that will let me change my music preferences no point in trying apples system if it doesnt have basic functionality like that,1,5/20/2022 8:59,Apple Music,IOS

,im going to split this reveiw into 2 parts the good this app is prettey good at getting you into meditation  better sleep  and can help you calm down in moments of overwhelm and panic the bad however  this app has its flaws the first flaw is that too much stuff is premium i know  i know  people still have to make money but 76 of stuff is premium 50 of stuff should be premium in my opinion  but  just know  this is my opinion i dont know what works for people of the app the second flaw is that  sometimes  when you try to play a free masterclass   free as in no lock icon wich basically means free  it makes you try premium this is a common marketing ploy that i hate finally  the third flaw this app is way too much for a premium i hope you change some things  calm,3,2/22/2023 21:47,Amazon Music,IOS

,i have been using this app for the past year consistently i love it and it iswas my favorite meditation app i have recommended it to more people than any other app probably the meditations that i used it for were the body scan and the loving kindness   this morning i went to use it and saw that loving kindness is no longer free and requires the annual 60 subscription im sorry but even if i used all of the features in the app i think that is pretty expensive i understand a lot of work and effort goes into this app and thats why its so great  but for someone like myself who really only wants to use two of the meditations  why not offer an option to purchase access to those meditations specifically i would pay a few dollars for each of those to have permanent access instead of getting some of my money you dont get any now with the current model please consider different purchase options,1,4/13/2018 17:11,Amazon Music,IOS
,i love the idea of the app but i cant afford it i have trouble falling asleep when my boyfriend is out of town so i was looking into the app and the sleep stories and calming noises sounded awesome but i personally cant afford a yearly subscription for unlimited access if there were even 510 options for every single thing  the app would probably have more downloads or  a monthly 25 subscription rather than its all coming out at once it would save 10 a year minimum and up to almost 50 a year the app might even make more money and be able to reach poor teens who cant afford stuff like myself i have one subscription that isnt a bill i can afford 2 75 subscriptions a year i just wish is was more available to a majority of teens and young people or even busy parents who cant afford stuff for themselves a cheaper option might be great or do a 30second add before each story to make money and the upgrade includes no ads just some ideas from a poor teen that can barely pay bills and eat spaghettios twice a week,2,9/10/2020 1:35,Amazon Music,IOS
,to start off id like to say this music app has been my main one for the past 3 years possibly longer so needless to say i know my fair share of what has been added and what still needs addressing   a main reason i am writing this review is because of a new bug that is occurring for many users including myself i think it is only on ios devices but it may be on all platforms  that i do not know for sure but the bug is when we play our music for 510 minutes sometimes longer and then out of nowhere the app shuts off the music almost as if its lost connection this is happening while being a premium member so dont tell me offline listening isnt an option please address this bug  i and many other people are having our music shut off for no apparent reason   ill note that i am using an iphone 11 so my device is fully capable my only other concern is the fact that you guys add unwanted music to our playlists despite us taking it off already we take 1 song off that you suggested  you add another thats horrible business practice and if anything will deter people from purchasing premium  not the other way around   fix this bug  and please stop cramming unwanted songs into our playlists thank you,3,4/14/2021 2:24,Spotify,IOS

,i loved this app it was always open on my phone  listen to it everyday until a update took my radio away you have playlists and playlist radio but its no where close to the radio we had i used to just play a radio station and never heard the same song more then twice a day now unless i pull my phone out of my pocket every hour im forced to listen to the same 30 songs over and over and over that defeats the purpose of a radio considering i pay for this im not impressed anymore apple music may end up with my money now they still have a radio integrated in their app i sincerely hope you will try to integrate the radio option back in to the app   thank you for you time   brandon,5,2/1/2019 22:05,Spotify,IOS
,after looking into guided meditation classes where i live  i found this app compare paying 59 year  being able to do it 247 wherever i am  to paying 1015 each class that i would have to travel to was no contest   a review below negatively complained about having to pay for the app thats ridiculous not only is the app well worth it  how can you put a pricetag on your happiness  mental well being a lot of time  energy  money goes into producing apps so to expect one especially one as great as this one to be free is fairly self righteous   this app is absolutely amazing  has changed my life in too many ways to count i would recommend it for everyone,5,9/2/2017 14:13,Amazon Music,IOS
,as mentioned  the app is good semi wonderful interface and easy to use however  there are some questionable choices to get you to use premium you arent allowed to fully play specific songs in your playlist  and you are only allowed 6 song skips an hour this is a pain for me since my song playlists are long the only way to hear the specific song i want is to shuffle enough times to hope itll run if i search the song up  it will find a playlist with the song in it not  the actual song i want to listen to again  the app itself is good and theres lots of music choices to choose from but as someone who sometimes wants to listen to a specific song and have long playlists  this can be and is easily a pain to deal with i dont believe anyone should have to pay to find something they could find for free elsewhere,3,1/19/2022 19:32,Spotify,IOS
,i love the idea of getting recommendations for playlists however  most of them completely miss the mark for instrumental playlists i get songs with lyrics for playlists that feature one artist  i get stuff from other bands for kids playlists i get x rated rubbish why not include some parameters or filters this cool feature could be so much better also miss the genius playlists where you can select songs based on bpm etc,3,4/27/2024 15:30,Apple Music,IOS

,i noticed that this app is not doing very good on the updates and the updates are such a nuisance they are useless and i also noticed that on some of the ads say 30 minutes of ad free well when i press it when my song ends next thing i get a ad like it would be better if you didnt even put that 30 minutes of ad free than lying to people about being ad free for 30 minutes your updates are very useless so please fix that too and theres not many skips as other music apps for example pandora has way more skips and i noticed that makes me super annoyed that when you put a album by a certain artist the song is super random and its not related to the artist at all that is very annoying and it may be to others please fix all of this and please make your updates useful to help this problems and probably your rates for this app will get better that is all i suggest to fix about this app,2,1/6/2019 19:33,Spotify,IOS

,i got this app for the free music  and at first it was amazing after about a month of listening there had come to be an ad after every song  and i had to get premium  to stop the ads  which is irritating  but worth it it worked driving through the mountains with no service with the premium  and i have loved it since  ive recently had an issue however  with songs not wanting to play ive tried both on and off wifi  data  and just the downloaded content but almost my entire library wont play for more than 15 seconds ive also tried deleting other apps and photos from the phone thinking it was a space issue but have continued to have this problem its only been an issue since the most recent update and its getting very frustrating because id just like to listen and it isnt working ive also tried closing out the app  restarting the phone  and a couple other things with no luck,4,6/9/2021 4:33,Spotify,IOS

,i bought a lifetime subscription in 2019 one week ago  i updated my phone for the first time in those 5 years i was suddenly locked out of calm premium though my account history still showed all the thousands of hours of listening ive done  im stuck in an endless loop of generic  unrelated macros with their support team who seems unempowered to actually help its been 8 days  and based on the emails ive gotten  i dont think anyone has actually read my requests or looked at my account  i depend on calm for sleep their product is amazing  but this horrible  stressful experience with their support team will make me use a different service just as soon as i find one,2,4/20/2024 3:15,Amazon Music,IOS
,i wouldnt recommend this app unless you only listen to music at home or want to pay 10 a month for premium i cant afford to pay 10 a month and i mostly listen to my music on the road this morning i went to listen to one of my playlists and it just was so glitchy it said i was listening to another song when i know for a fact that i was not listening to the song it said i was this really bothered me i tried pausing and playing it again to see if that would fix it but then it just skipped it and starting playing music i really dont like i tried listening to other stuff but i really wanted to listen to my favorites i went back to it and it only played my recommend stuff which is probably the worst recommend playlist i have ever heard because i didnt like any of the stuff they played for me the only reason i give this 2 stars is the fact that they have all the music i want in stead of me having to pay 15 for a soundtrack,2,5/5/2018 11:17,Spotify,IOS
,on the front page  same as play and forward there should be a button to save this song to the playlist she dont have to go into the and use passcode to enter the phone so you can save a song it should be done on the first page as well its unfortunate that you cannot go to the previous song that is a very stupid not to be able to go back to the previous song or the previous track it is a ridiculous that you have to go to history to find the last song that you were playing what kind ofgenius had that idea to take away rewind the previous track please fix that  i have problems please play my playlist recently playing music from my playlist if eight play this has 400 songs and plays maybe 30 or 40 of them app constantly repeats the same and music it doesnt go through the whole 400 songs are in the playlist,5,7/19/2024 19:02,YouTube Music,IOS
,the radio and daily mix features are so bad i constantly have the same 20 or so songs being suggested to me  no matter the genre  playlist or what its always the same songs sometimes the recommendations make zero sense but they just put the same songs that i used to love  and now hate because ive heard them way way too many times i have opened song radios only to find that i know every single one of the 50 songs in that song radio  and i know that none of them fit the same genre as a song that i was originally clicking to make the song radio for im beginning to hate all of the songs i listen to and i am struggling to find new music fix your song suggestions feature the mobile app is pretty good but on the desktop app  its so slow and always struggles to connect to my speakers  it doesnt crash but it does stop working to the point that i have to force quit it pretty often also  i really dont like that it reshuffles my playlistqueue when i switch the device im using,2,3/11/2021 3:38,Spotify,IOS

,i love this app  just a few complaints first of all  i dont like how it adds songs to a playlist i made  and i barely even know them adding onto that  i dont like how it only allows 6 skips per hour  because after i skip through the songs the add on i have no skips left they also make it so you cant skip back to a song sometimes i press skip by accident and then i cant go back also  they say watch this video for 30 minutes of uninterrupted music its more like 20 for me also  the adds are constantly the same thing  even after ive put a bad review on them one last thing i dont know if this is my phone itself or it is the app  but after about an hour of music it randomly stops playing   over all this app if fantastic  but it would make it better if they changed the things i just listed,4,2/6/2021 15:58,Spotify,IOS

,they got a solid app that works excellent and rarely has any issues it is easy to navigate  easy to store music and easy to sort music into playlists i do recommend turning off car mode their discover weeklyrecommendations usually seem based on whoever makes them the most money and seldom feels like it is based on your listening habits the release radar also seems to pepper in artists youd never listen to and again appears based on monetary gain the real issue is that they are constantly pushing political agendas on their home screen i listen to music to escape stress not have it shoved in my face when im trying to destress there is also no way to remove the political garbage from the home screen now the app itself could be a solid 5 stars but as soon as its used to force bad political ideologies without a way to hide it  well then i start to consider using a different platform and can no longer recommend this app please note that i have used this app for years before making this review,3,4/23/2021 14:26,Spotify,IOS

,at first  its all cool the upside is that you can play the music you want however you cant listen to a song itself  you have to add that song to a playlist and you cant listen to the playlist in order  its always in shuffle theres also a ridiculous number of ads you can get rid of these things by paying a monthly payment which i dont have the money for however  that is not what made me write this review   every time  i open the app and start playing a song after a period of thirty minutes to an hour  the app closes and the song stops playing so i restart the app and the song however it does this several times in a row i have done everything to deleting the app and reinstalling it  to making sure enough stuff is deleted off my storage space i have also searched the internet looking for a solution and found none at first i just dealt with it  but after so long it becomes really frustrating and with that plus all the ads  it just isnt worth the hassle   the final straw was today when i kept getting suggested tracks on a playlist that already had over an hour worth of songs normally  since this isnt happening to other people  i would just assume it has something to do with my phone but it only happens with this app and only this app   and if you try to give them a complaint or ask for customer service  its like hurting cats its absolutely not worth it,5,1/15/2021 3:51,Spotify,IOS

,so the app is good  i like how you can make playlists and share them with your friends  but there is just one thing i dont really like on some songs  it has a behind the lyrics thing that tells you what the songs are supposed to mean this is ok  except for some songs it has some inappropriate language for example  cant feel my face by the weeknd  the song is not explicit  it has no swear words or anything  so it would be suitable for children of any age to listen to this song but  little kids may not know that the song is about drugs  because it never actually says that she is actually cocaine however  in the behind the lyrics  it talks about the effects of cocaine  and has snippets of conversations with the weeknd  in which he says some language that i wish was not there that is all i have to say   maya,4,1/22/2021 2:12,Spotify,IOS

,my husband loves to use the calm app for its daily calm videos and i love to listen to the sound scapes for sleep both of these things help us relax after a long exhausting day there is one thing i wish this app had though and that is poetry id love to hear a celebrity or anyone really read poetry its calming to listen to the rhythm of the words while also focusing on the message or story being told they do have something called the poetry pharmacy which i listen too when stressed but the poems arent very long so it isnt something i can listen to when trying to relax before bed,5,10/20/2021 10:39,Amazon Music,IOS

,pretty great and all but after you set your genre preferences and choose some artists when youre setting everything up  i wish it at least warned me that i would never be able to do that again its actually really trash that i cant seem to just love an artist so my music is influenced by the artist all together instead of songs or albums if i could set preferences like in the beginning of using this app at all times then id be a lifetime subscriber for sure but as of now im not looking much further than the 6 month free trial i got with my airpods,3,4/10/2022 15:53,Apple Music,IOS

,the selection of music is great  but this app is a nightmare to use the fact that there is no way to clear your queue is unbelievably bad design in this day and age accidentally add a 16 hour playlist to your queue now any song you play  any album  any other playlist  it plays the first song and then goes right back to your queue there is no way to escape the queue aside from either going through and removing each song one by one  or deleting and reinstalling the app i switched from apple music because of spotifys slightly better music selection  but if it wasnt for a couple family members i have on my plan  id switch back in a second,5,7/23/2020 22:37,Spotify,IOS
,i love this app so much  i do think its unreasonable for them to gatekeep the lyrics  but they need to make a profit  so i dont mind spending a few dollars a month for premium  if you cant afford the 10 subscription  thats fine since the app is free  but there are alot of things locked behind premium  like you can only skip a few times an hour  you can only access lyrics 3x a month  and theres ads  but being a 5yr user of this app  i can say that even with the paywall  the app is great and if you can afford to get premium you should  and also  if you cant afford premium  please dont think you have to  it just lets you do a few extra things  so if you cant currently afford it  save your money for more important things,5,6/15/2024 23:16,Spotify,IOS
,i like pretty much everything about this app except for one small thing i dont like the fact that you cant exit the app or turn off your phone without the music stopping this can also take a huge toll on battery as well from the phone constantly being on rather than off with some background activity if you could make it so that its possible to exit appturn off phone and the music keeps playing that would be great thanks,4,1/16/2021 4:30,YouTube Music,IOS

,5 stars and the only caveat is on ios when you search for an artist and then hit albums and play a certain album  if at then end of the album you want another by the same artist you have to re search for the artist instead of a simple back button  usually it may depend on how long its been since having the app open or something anyway i find myself having to research the same artist many times,4,12/19/2020 14:43,YouTube Music,IOS

,this app used to be the highest of my phone but with every update the layout of the app gets worse and worse the current layout of just playlist is so inconvenient as opposed to the previous one where it would have your most recently played music laid out the moving of the settings to the home screen makes changing the eq and sound quality such a burden in comparison to what it was also i used to be able to go under the artist tab and even able to listen to all the songs i have saved from the artist specifically but now if i go i see all of the songs instead of the the saved despite being able to do that before these last few updates have been rather reductive and if they continue to degrade i will find another app to use for my music i highly recommend the company roll back some of its cosmetic changes to the app because they arent good changes and also return some of the practical functions the app used to have like being able to listen and shuffle to specific saved song by artist instead of having to make an entire playlist just to be able to listen to one artist or one album,1,1/16/2020 0:27,Spotify,IOS

,i often cast music from the app on my sony tv whenever it is connected to the tv  overall app behavior becomes different  here are few examples  1 when i play from my downloaded list  it does not follow the list itself depending on what song i select to play from the downloaded list  the queue becomes random with songs which is not in sync  order with my list  2 moving a song up  down in the list also doesnt work well  if i try to drag a song from one position to another  and i hold down for longer than 23 seconds  the drag auto releases  and scrolls back to where i originally started the drag from  3 switching between song  video on the top bar is very slow  and sometimes reverses my choice  i have also seen a song being paused when attempting to switch tofrom song  video  besides this or when just using the app without being connected to the tv  it works great  just wish the integration was smoother for my particular scenario  using iphone 11 pro and have autoupdate on for apps  and the tv is brand new sony  so everything is relatively up to date on my side,4,6/27/2020 18:32,YouTube Music,IOS

,the ads ive seen for this app are heavily centered around assisting people going to sleep  so its odd that 10 minutes of searching lead to only finding 3 sleep stories on the free version i dont care to go through every album to count how many are available  but its pathetic that it requires extensive searching to find one  i even redownloaded the when i was coming to write a review the first time because there were reviews shaming other reviews for not looking hard enough for the unlocked content im now convinced that those reviews were forged by the developers  or they were looking for something other than a sleep app  when you start the app and go to the home page  it presents a variety of different tracks  and every one of the was locked but a motivational talk by lebron james at this point  im just typing to be typing this app is a joke  i have no intentions of paying 70 a year not by months for an app that wont let me preview what im getting  yeah  i could do the 1 week trial  but if i dont cancel in time then im out 70 ,1,8/17/2021 10:07,Amazon Music,IOS

,i love the app for the most part but there are things i think need to be corrected if i put a song to play next  that needs to play next regardless of im shuffling a playlist i dont want the song to drop down the playing next list bring back the album cover playlist imagery no one wants these ugly monochrome playlist covers  give us the option to just use the album art again there are too many songs not available in your country or region but thats nonsense because if you go to the artists page  you can play the song,2,1/24/2024 22:27,Apple Music,IOS
,calm is my favorite app at the moment my sister and i listen to the sleep stories every night  and we love it i am asleep in minutes  i dont even know what happens at the end of half the stories i listen to my father came in my room one night and thought the music i was listening to was very relaxing  and i agreed the music is also great i bought premium and it is so worth it you get access to everything i do the breathing exercises every day before school it definitely calms your mind most of the narrators voices are very calming another thing is that every time you open the app it greets you with take a deep breath you can also change the backround which comes with calming music overall great app,5,4/22/2020 22:35,Amazon Music,IOS
,i love this app and have paid for apple music since it was introduced however  lately every morning when i open my app the music i was listening to the day before has been cleared and my now playing is blank its really frustrating cause i will listen to the same playlist for a few days  or ill shuffle an artists library ill get halfway through the tracks and then the next day i have to reselect what i was listening to and start all over please fix this bug,3,4/20/2022 14:35,Apple Music,IOS

a5809bc3-b1c0-483f-95de-536be7f17cb5,update i started using this app to listen to books as well and its a rip off after so long they want you to add 10 more liatening hours for 13 thats a wild amount when i already pay for the premium version awesome app for music  its like they understand my musical soul one of my fave parts is the daily mixes  takes everything you know and love and shuffles in many new amazing songs  best partdifferent mixes for different moods,3,2/17/2025 13:04,Spotify,Android
,still love the app but wish they would add more sleep stories not meditations  not sleep music  but sleep stories that is what helps me the most ive emailed them twice to request more stories the response has been that stories are added every week but this is not true it rotates between additions of sleep music  meditations and stories so in truth  about one to two a month are added  if you have as big a problem as i do sleeping then the repitition of the same stories over and over becomes less effective  ive looked everywhere else for more stories but calm is still the best for stories i just wish they focused as much on the stories as they do on meditation   i have serious trouble sleeping  and the calm sleep stories are a big help for me i can listen to them and focus on the reader and my mind wont wander off like it always does to a million other things before i know it im asleep,4,1/10/2018 8:19,Amazon Music,IOS

,my doctor had shared with me about the benefits of meditation i needed something to help when i was anxious as well something to help me relax shortly after that doctor visit i found the calm app its been 5 years it had been a stressful day and there was an introduction to the app and i took the 10 minutes and did the breathing and really focused on relaxing i went back to work and i immediately told everyone about calm i have been using it ever since the time i meditate is my time to focus  to breathe and to just be in the moment i had horrible insomnia and started the body scans i tried the sessions without buying the subscription but soon found that i wanted more of the sessions after i did the first so i bought the subscription and have never regretted it once its been a godsend i love the bedtime stories and the daily calm there is so much on this app that has helped me i love that the app is adding new things thank you tamara and your wonderful team for sharing and helping me bring peace and calm into my life,5,10/11/2021 4:45,Amazon Music,IOS
,i am still extremely annoyed that the recently played page has gone away and been changed to a much more confusing layout the fact you cant even see all artists under the artists tab unless youve downloaded all their music is just stupid also downloaded songs are apparently no longer liked automatically  so theres no way to play all downloaded songs unless you manually like every single download also im not sure if this is a bug  but songs dont start to play unless you click on them twice now  which is pointless all the recent changes are bad  please go back to how things were before  especially the recently played section that showed artistsplaylistssongsalbumsradio stations  etc and gave you the option to edit and remove them from the page or at least add a songs section instead of just playlists  artists which doesnt even show all your artists  so whats the point and albums navigating the app as it is now is so much more confusing  tedious  and time consuming than it used to be,1,4/4/2019 1:49,Spotify,IOS

,apple music is alright until you accidentally merge 2 playlist together and theres no 2nd conformation notification which apple likes doing so much but decides not to have it when you accidentally merge them  ok another thing is why cant we select all the music we dont want in a playlist anymore but we have to take 1 minute of our time to delete them one by one unless theres a option or whatever to select them all then  im all hears another thing why isnt there a recently deleted playlist  again im clumsy  and accidentally deleted a playlist and been looking for hours  unless im not looking hard enough  also apple likes doing a lot of recently deleted why didnt they not put that into apple music ,3,11/14/2022 17:01,Apple Music,IOS
,every update pushes more useless features on you to keep you engaged  you can feel big tech trying to influence your behavior even when you are a paying customer premium members should have more control over the app i bet if these reviews were divided between paying users and non paying users it would show those of us paying think this app is trash stop treating customers paying for the service the same as those that arent i dont want my data harvested and i dont want your trash algorithm thinking it knows better than i do when it comes to what i want to see or listen to,1,10/4/2024 1:48,YouTube Music,IOS

,why am i paying for premium if im still having to listen to ads when listening to podcasts  i really do not care who is sponsoring the ones im listening to i would simply just like to listen to the podcast all the way through maybe its an issue for the person who records the podcast  but its still frustrating  also  when i add songs to my liked songs playlist and hit shuffle  i expect to hear different songs every time instead  ill hit shuffle lets say in the morning  and once i hit shuffle again later itll just shuffle the songs in the same order as the last i dont have a ton of songs on my playlist just to listen to the same ones over and over again,4,12/29/2023 18:13,Spotify,IOS
,ill keep it simple the fact that the music app takes over every time in my car bluetooth after a phone call is nuisance enough for me to delete the app from my phone and the fact that it always starts at the beginning of the same song when it starts is even more frustrating combine that with the fact that random order is not random at all apple music changes the order of the songs in a playlist but plays the songs in that same order every time makes me less interested in enduring the frustration when i have other options,1,9/29/2023 16:21,Apple Music,IOS
